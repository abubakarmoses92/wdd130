    <h1>My Favorite City</h1>
    <p>Dublin is my favorite city. Dublin, the capital of the Republic of Ireland, is on Ireland’s east coast at the
        mouth of the River Liffey. Its historic buildings include Dublin Castle, dating to the 13th century, and the
        imposing St Patrick’s Cathedral, founded in 1191. City parks include landscaped St Stephen’s Green and huge
        Phoenix Park, containing Dublin Zoo. The National Museum of Ireland explores Irish heritage and culture.</p>
